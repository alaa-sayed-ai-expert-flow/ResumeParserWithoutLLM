consistent diameter and roundness. the filament extrusion plant was designed to be scalable, making it possible to increase production capacity as needed.     importance the development of an economical filament extrusion plant was important as it made the production of 3d printer filament more accessible and affordable. by reducing the cost of 3d printer filament, it became possible for more people to use 3d printing technology, leading to a wider range of applications. the economical filament extrusion plant also opened up new opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses to enter the 3d printing market.     outcomes the filament extrusion plant was successfully designed and fabricated, and has been producing high-quality 3d printer filament at a lower cost. the successful outcome of this project has helped to increase the accessibility of 3d printing technology, making it more affordable and available to a wider range of users. the filament extrusion plant has received positive feedback from users and businesses, and has helped to increase the adoption of 3d printing technology in various industries and applications.   \n"
